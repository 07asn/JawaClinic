# Clinic Appointment System

## Project Overview

This project is a clinic appointment system designed to streamline appointment bookings, manage clinic staff, and allow patients, doctors, receptionists, and managers to interact efficiently. The system implements role-based APIs for four user categories: **patients**, **doctors**, **receptionists**, and **managers**.

The system supports a multi-step booking cycle for appointments, allowing patients to book appointments, view visit details, and enabling doctors to document diagnoses and services provided. It also provides features for managing clinic staff, services, and pricing.
